## A Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Risk of Heart Disease
This project aimed to create a reliable and understandable machine learning model that could be used to predict whether a patient would have heart disease.  The final artefact is a proof-of-concept for a predictive tool intended to move cardiology toward data-driven decision-making, using a set of clinical and demographic features.
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
The primary cause of death worldwide is still heart disease.  Traditional diagnostic techniques can be costly, time-consuming, or resource-intensive, even though early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and patient outcomes.  This project's main challenge was the need for an accurate and affordable initial screening method that can help physicians quickly identify high-risk patients, expedite diagnostic processes, and start preventative measures earlier. By doing so, patients' health will be greatly improved, and the strain on healthcare systems will be lessened.
The following precise, quantifiable goals served as the project's guidelines:

 Model Development: To create a Logistic Regression algorithm that is highly interpretable for predicting the risk of heart disease.

 Accuracy Goal: Using unseen patient data, train and validate the model to achieve a high, balanced accuracy in predicting the presence or absence of heart disease.

 Clinical Utility: To ensure the model can be integrated to support earlier clinical decision support, optimise resource allocation, and serve as a basis for proactive screening.
 ### METHODOLOGY
 The Logistic Regression model was chosen because it strikes a balance between excellent performance and remarkable interpretability, which is important in clinical settings.

 301 patient records containing important clinical and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, type of chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and exercise-induced angina) were used to train and assess the model.

 Model Training: The entire dataset was meticulously divided into separate subsets for testing and training.  The model was rigorously tested against the independent test set after being trained on the training data to determine whether it could reduce the risk of overfitting and generalise to new, unseen patient cases.

 Evaluation: To obtain a thorough grasp of classification behaviour, especially for the crucial "Heart Disease Present" class, performance was evaluated using overall accuracy in addition to Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
### Key Results & Model Performance
The model achieved an Overall Accuracy of 85% on the independent test dataset.

### KEY INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
#### KEY INSIGHTS
1. High Predictive Reliability: With a balanced overall accuracy of 85%, the model showed excellent predictive capabilities.
2. Effective Case Identification: The most important metric is the recall for the "Yes" class (83%) as a whole.  This indicates that the model was successful in identifying the great majority of patients who actually had heart disease, allowing for quicker and more effective clinical intervention.
3. Clinical Interpretability: By using Logistic Regression, cardiologists can gain insight into which clinical characteristics—such as high cholesterol or particular types of chest pain—are responsible for the predicted risk score. This provides useful information that goes beyond a straightforward binary prediction.
4. Area for Improvement: The necessity for ongoing improvement is highlighted by the existence of seven False Negatives, or missed actual disease cases.  Even though they are rare, reducing these serious mistakes is crucial for patient safety.
#### RECOMMENDATIONS
1. With an emphasis on reducing false negatives in subsequent iterations, the current model ought to be positioned as a Level 1 Clinical Decision Support Tool.
2. The main suggestion is to use the risk score output as an AI-powered "second opinion" in Electronic Health Records (EHRs).  This will assist clinicians in identifying patients, even those with mild initial symptoms, who may require more aggressive or earlier diagnostic tests (e.g., stress tests) based on their predicted risk.
3. Feature engineering is the process of improving already-existing features or adding fresh information (such as genetic markers) to target and lower the False Negative rate.
 ### CONCLUSION
With an accuracy benchmark of 85%, this project effectively validated the use of logistic regression as a potent, interpretable tool for initial heart disease risk assessment.
The model offers a solid basis for a solution that can greatly improve proactive care by skillfully striking a balance between recall and precision.
The work provides a tangible asset that can be incorporated into clinical workflows, going beyond basic data analysis.
The proven ability to identify 83% of true cases represents a significant improvement in early identification potential, providing a clear path toward improving patient outcomes and healthcare resource management, even as the current challenge of 7 false negatives directs our future development roadmap.
